### Instructions for Capturing Git Log:

1. **Generate a detailed git log:**

   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all --date=short --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
   ```

2. **For hourly commits visualization:**

   ```bash
   git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s" --since="1 day ago"
   ```

3. **Take screenshots of:**
   - Full commit history showing development timeline
   - Hourly commit patterns during active development
   - Branch structure and merges

### Screenshot Guidelines:

- Capture the entire terminal window showing git log
- Ensure timestamps are visible
- Include commit hashes and messages
- Show branch information if applicable
